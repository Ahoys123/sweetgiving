				Join us at our delightful bake sale where every treat is baked with love and a purpose. At our bake sale, 
				we are passionate about two things: baking delicious goodies and giving back to our community. 
				That's why we are proud to announce that 100% of the proceeds from this event will be donated to various non-profit 
				organizations that are making a difference in our community. We bake every confection from scratch, making sure that they are 
				baked carefully and with love. We have tried and tested each recipe many times to get the perfect texture and taste! 
				We hope you love the treats as much as we do and help the community in the process.

				All of the money for this bake sale is going to the Compass Family Services to help fight homelessness. 
				This organization provides housing, child-care, behavioral health/mental health care, early childhood education, and employment 
				assistance to San Franciscans who are homeless. They work to stop homelessness at the root and help the homeless people get jobs 
				in an attempt to stop their problems for good, not give them temporary solutions. We resonate deeply with this goal—trying to give 
				these people the support they need so that they can get back on their feet and sustain themselves for the rest of their lives.

			So please mark your calendars and bring your sweet tooth to our bake sale, as your support will not only satisfy your cravings 
			but also help us spread love, hope, and positive change throughout our community. Thank you!

					Hello! My name is Laura and I absolutely love to bake! I find that the prospect of being able to create 
					anything I want is extremely exciting and motivational. I am continuously amazed by the fact that you can 
					combine such simple ingredients again and again in different manners to create something brand new each time.
					I love to use my artistic abilities as well to decorate and perfect my confections. 
					I love to hone my skills in this craft in my free time and whip up a storm of cookies, cakes, and pastries for my family to enjoy. 
					I bake not only for the personal enjoyment it brings, but also for the happiness it can bring to others. 
					Baked goods have the power to put a smile on anyone’s face, which just warms my heart. I love to see people happy and to make 
					their day just a little better, which fuels my passion for baking even more. Then, one day, when Aliyah and I went to San Francisco 
					for the first time, we saw a substantial number of homeless people lying on the sides of the road. Some were yelling, some looked 
					lifeless. The sheer number of them made Aliyah and I feel a deep sadness and a desire to help them. So, we combined these two things 
					that we love—baking and our community—into this non-profit baking adventure, Sweet Givings. We buy all the ingredients and bake for 
					4 days straight, producing over 200 items, and make over $1000 per bake sale. We give 100% of it away to charities that help the 
					homeless find food, jobs, and a home. We do not pay ourselves for our time or for the ingredients because we want to help our 
					communities as much as we can. Thank you so much for helping our dream come to fruition and we sincerely hope you join us on this 
					journey to give back through sweets! Thank you.

					Hey everyone! My name is Aliyah. I love baking and helping people in any way I can. It is a passion of mine. 
					I love seeing people enjoy the delicious treats I make for them. Whether it's a simple cookie or an extravagant multi 
					layered cake with a colorful frosting. As long as I get to make it, I'm happy. As much as I love baking, I love helping people. 
					From a young age, I have had this passion to help anyone who needs it. From giving someone a pencil in class to giving out 
					mini essential bags to the homeless during quarantine. I have always believed that we should be helping each other if possible. 
					Ever since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of homeless individuals have increased. It saddens me that this has happened. 
					That's why Laura and I want to raise money to help these people who need it the most. Putting together both of our passions 
					motivate us to do what we love while helping others at the same time. With your help, we will be able to raise money to get 
					people off the street into houses. Any money that is donated or used to buy our treats are greatly appreciated. We hope you 
					enjoy our treats and thank you again for your help!
